## Annual fee

The annual fee for 2024-2025 is **52.000kr**--.

Changes have been made to the fee schedule of the fellowship. From 2024 there will be a single fee charged for the school year from september 2024 to june 2025.

Previously fees were scheduled for each school semester, once in autumn and again in spring. The semester fee in 2024 was 23.000kr per semester, equivelant to a 46.000kr annual fee. The fee is now increasing to 26.000kr per semester, equivelant to the 52.000kr annual fee, which is due to be paid once.

### What is included in the annual fee?

The annual fee covers the weekly scout meeting schedule, patrol camping trips, scout scarfs (neckers), any badges the scout earns, some Skjöldungar identifying accessories, and subsidies for troop camping trips.

### Sibling discount

A 10% sibling discount is applied automatically. Reykjavík City's "leisure card" (frístundakort) can still be used to pay the annual fee. Additionally, payments can be split.

**To ease with this change in fee scheduling, we kindly ask parents/guardians to be in contact with us if this fee schedule is not desirable.**
