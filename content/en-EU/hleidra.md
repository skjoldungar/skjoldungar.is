## About the cabin

Hleiðra is a scout cabin of Skjöldungar located at Hafravatn. The cabin is ideal for scout troops, with sleeping space for up to 10–12 people in beds, and an additional sleeping loft with mattresses. There is a small kitchen area and a dining table with several chairs.

There is no electricity in the cabin, but it is heated with gas heaters. The cabin has a water toilet during summer; in winter the water is turned off.

The area around the cabin includes a grove with a fire pit and trees suitable for hammocks. There is also a grassy area outside the cabin that is well suited for tents.
